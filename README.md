Here are some quick things about me:

- 💫 I am a self-taught coder ~
- 🔭 Currently working on Robotics & Embedded & ME & CS, and want to learn everything interesting.
- 🌱 I am passionate about open source, as my past self-taught programming experience drives my desire to give back and contribute to the open source community that has helped me so much.
- ❤️ I like eating 🍉, raising 🐈, cycling 🚵, sleeping in 🛌 and watching [ACGN](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACG_(subculture)>) 📺.
